                <h2>How Zoho Bookings helps schedule one-on-one meetings</h2>
                <p class="zb-para">Zoho Bookings is a versatile scheduling app, allowing students to self-schedule appointments in seconds and saving you hours of manual work. This means you can focus on teaching your sessions-rather than scheduling them, notifying students and collecting payments-all using a single app.</p>

                <div class="choose-work-left">
                    <h3>Choose a workspace</h3>
                    <p>Workspaces are virtual spaces for a set of services. For instance, if you run mental health clinics across the state using multiple workspaces, you’d choose your preferred workspace and name your meeting. You can stick to the default workspace if you operate your business from a single location.</p>

                    <h3>Set your service duration</h3>
                    <p>Determine the length of your one-on-one meetings, whether it’s minutes or hours long. For example, if your company uses Zoho Bookings for internal meetings, create multiple one-on-ones with different durations to suit your preferences.</p>
